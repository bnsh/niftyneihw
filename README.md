# Nifty Nei Homework

This is homework [@starcox64](https://twitter.com/starcox64) and I did on [Nifty Nei](https://twitter.com/niftynei)'s [Bitcoin Transactions](https://www.udemy.com/course/base58-bitcoin-transactions-one/) class.

You'll need the bitcoin library we wrote at [cryptodockers](https://github.com/bnsh/cryptodockers/): Specifically, [bitcoin_lib.py](https://github.com/bnsh/cryptodockers/blob/main/demos/bitcoin_lib.py) and [common_config.py](https://github.com/bnsh/cryptodockers/blob/main/demos/common_config.py). (See the [demos](https://github.com/bnsh/cryptodockers/tree/main/demos) [README.md](https://github.com/bnsh/cryptodockers/blob/main/demos/README.md) for instructions on how to set this up. (There's a whole ssh and raspberry pi insanity. We didn't really make this for _real_ general consumption, sorry..)

If you are [Nifty Nei](https://twitter.com/niftynei), Hi! Thanks! We really enjoyed your class! (Well, we _are_ enjoy**ing** your class right now.)
